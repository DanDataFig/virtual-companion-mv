- **Visual Metaphors**: Flowing energy, organic digital forms, gentle luminescence
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with rich avatar presence

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with ethereal accent
- **Primary Color**: Deep cosmic blue `oklch(0.25 0.15 240)` - trustworthy and calming
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft whites and light grays for clean interface
- **Accent Color**: Ethereal cyan `oklch(0.70 0.20 200)` - digital presence indicator
- **Color Psychology**: Blues for trust and calm, cyan for digital connection, whites for clarity
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast maintained with dark text on light backgrounds
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white): Dark text `oklch(0.10 0.005 240)` ✓ 4.5:1+
  - Primary (deep blue): White text `oklch(1.00 0 0)` ✓ 4.5:1+
  - Accent (cyan): Dark text `oklch(0.10 0.005 240)` ✓ 4.5:1+

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for clean, modern interface text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between avatar speech, user input, and UI elements
- **Font Personality**: Clean, approachable, slightly futuristic
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing for comfortable conversation reading
- **Typography Consistency**: Single font family with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Which fonts**: Inter (already loaded) for all text elements
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible across all sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Avatar dominates visual space, conversation flows naturally below
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing around avatar and conversation to create calm
- **Grid System**: Flexible layout adapting to avatar prominence and conversation flow
- **Responsive Approach**: Avatar scales appropriately, conversation remains accessible
- **Content Density**: Minimal UI chrome, maximum focus on avatar and conversation

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle avatar movements suggest life and presence
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Avatar gets primary animation focus, UI elements are secondary
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Gentle, organic movements that feel natural not mechanical

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for conversation bubbles, Input for text entry, minimal chrome
- **Component Customization**: Transparent/glass-morphic elements to maintain ethereal feel
- **Component States**: Subtle hover states, clear focus indicators for accessibility
- **Icon Selection**: Minimal icons, primarily send/microphone for input
- **Component Hierarchy**: Avatar primary, conversation secondary, input tertiary
- **Spacing System**: Consistent use of Tailwind spacing for visual rhythm
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Avatar scales down but remains prominent, conversation optimized for touch

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with avatar as central design anchor
- **Style Guide Elements**: Avatar styling, conversation bubbles, input styling
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and typography throughout
- **Brand Alignment**: Ethereal, empathetic, futuristic feel maintained across all elements

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum for all text and interactive elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Avatar Loading**: Graceful loading states while avatar initializes
- **Long Conversations**: Scrolling behavior that maintains avatar visibility
- **Input Validation**: Handling empty messages and conversation flow
- **Connection Issues**: Clear feedback when avatar presence is unavailable

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Foundation for voice input, avatar animation, emotional responses, long-term memory analytics
- **Testing Focus**: Avatar visual impact, conversation flow usability, memory accuracy and helpfulness
- **Critical Questions**: Does the avatar feel alive? Is the conversation interface intuitive? Does memory enhance rather than distract from the experience?

## Reflection
This approach prioritizes emotional connection through visual presence while maintaining a clean, accessible conversation interface. The ethereal avatar design sets this apart from typical chatbots by emphasizing the human-like presence and emotional resonance that defines the virtual presence concept. The addition of conversation memory creates continuity and deeper understanding, making each interaction feel more meaningful and connected to the user's emotional journey over time.
